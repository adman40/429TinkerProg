for testing, I manually validated output with the test files input.tk, input2.tk, input3.tk, input4.tk, and input5.tk
test 1 was a general case with macros, nonmacros, labeling, and multiple .code and .data refrences. The remaining files were 
fairly simple to test things like edge cases and the correct individual application of labeling, macros, nonmacros, etc
